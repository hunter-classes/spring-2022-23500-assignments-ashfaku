Bubble Sort: each element is "bubbled" to the top. very inefficient, not covered
Insertion Sort: You pick each item and "insert" it into its proper location, based on desired order, is often used with linked lists
Selection Sort: Go through your data set, pick smallest item, and move/swap it into first location, until you run out of elements to pick from.
Start from 0th element, swap it with the smallest value; then start from 1st element, swap it with second smallest value, and so on, until you're at last element

Auto in C++ means any type

for (int i : a)
	std::cout << i << std::endl;

for (auto i: a)
	std::cout << i << std::endl;

These are equivalent for each loops, but auto means it would work regardless of the type of elements a contains
