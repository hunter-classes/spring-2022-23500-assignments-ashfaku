		<h1>Memoization</h1>
		<p>
			<h2>-The process of storing already calculated values into an array or some data structure so you don't have to calculate them again.</h2>
			<h3>This code works, but it gets really slow once n reaches the high 20s and beyond.</h3>
			<code>
				<div>int stepPerms(int n)</div>
				<div>{</div>
					<div class = "one">if (n < 1)</div>
						<div class = "two">return 0;</div>
					<div class = "one">if (n < 3)</div>
						<div class = "two">return n;</div>
					<div class = "one">if (n == 3)</div>
						<div class = "two">return 4;</div>
					<div class = "one">return stepPerms(n - 1) + stepPerms(n - 2) + stepPerms(n - 3);</div>
				<div>}</div>
				
			</code>
			<h3>On the other hand, this code is similar, but is way more efficient, because the solutions array lets the recursive function add less to the stack.</h3>
			<h1>State Space Search</h1>
			<div>A World: uhhhhhhh</div>
			<p>A State: The current version of the world<p>
			<h1>Depth First Search</h1>
			<p>If you have a feeling your solution is far away from where you're starting, you can try starting from there instead.</p>
			<p>Recursive Search, Exhaustive Search or Blind Search</p>
			<p>These are often called exhaustive or blind because they have no smart logic behind them, or just try every possible guess.</p>
